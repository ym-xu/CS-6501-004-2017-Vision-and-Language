    "If you are taking this class you have some experience with machine learning. You probably already have used or at the very least have heard about deep learning. There are many deep learning libraries that allow you to easily create neural networks. For Python, the following are some libraries that I recommend based on my own experience or good experiences from other people I trust: <a href=\"http://pytorch.org/\">PyTorch</a>, <a href=\"https://keras.io/\">Keras</a> (using Theano or Tensorflow), <a href=\"http://mxnet.io/\">MXNet</a>, <a href=\"http://chainer.org/\">Chainer</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne\">Lasagne</a>. These libraries are all nice, and we will use them for our later labs and maybe the class project, but in this lab will be creating our own deep learning library: PyDeepTensorNet!\n",

    "\n",
    "After computing the output predictions $a$ it is necessary to compare these against the true values of $a$. Let's call these true, correct, or desired values $y$. A simple loss or cost function is used to measure the degree by which the prediction $a$ is wrong with respect to $y$. A common loss function for regression is the sum of squared differences between the prediction and its true value. Assuming a prediction $a^{(d)}$ for our training sample $x^{(d)}$ with true value $y^{(d)}$, then the loss can be computed as:\n",

So the function we are really trying to minimize is the following:\n",

We need to find how to move the values of $W$ and $b$ so that $Loss$ is minimal. In order to calculate the minimum of this function we can compute the derivatives of the function and find the zeroes: \n",

You can check in wikipedia a derivation of the normal equations for linear least squares <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares_(mathematics)#Derivation_of_the_normal_equations\">here</a>. However, we will take a different approach and solve this problem by iteratively following the direction of an approximate gradient using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) because this will be used for more complex models. We will also compute the derivatives using the Backpropagation algorithm."
